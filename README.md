# The Art of Code

No AI. No dependencies. Just raw code.

In the era of AI, code is becoming an art. The goal of
this project is to inspire other developers to get back
in touch with their roots and develop the old fashioned
way: no AI, no dependencies, just code.

## Blog

This is a work in progress. Once it is complete, I'll
write a blog post and link it here.

## Contributing

All are welcome to be apart of this. Here are the rules:

1. All commits must be written by a human
2. No external dependencies

That's it. Other than that, have fun.
